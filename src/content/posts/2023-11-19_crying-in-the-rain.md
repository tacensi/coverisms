Everly Brothers was a rock'n'roll duo formed by Don and Phil Everly. They released a number of hits in the late 50's and early 60's, like All I Have to Do is Dream, Wake Up Little Susie, Let it Be Me.

Crying in the Rain, released in 1961, was one of their most succesful songs. Written by Carole King and Howard Greenfield, the song captures the atmosphere of a rainy, lonely afternoon. Despite the success, King and Greenfield never wrote another song together.

## A-ha version

The song was convered by the Norwegian band in 1989 and released in the 1990 album East of the Sun, West of the Moon.

The band still captures the melancholy of the original recording, although and the video brings a story about a robbery that doesn't match the lyrics.

A-ha members got close to the Everly Brothers were presented guitars, which can be seen on the [Stay On These Roads album](https://www.discogs.com/pt_BR/release/1296811-a-ha-Stay-On-These-Roads). A-ha's member Magne Furuholmen told the story on an interview:

> “Our manager Terry Slater had played bass for the Everly Brothers during the ’60s and was a close personal friend of Phil Everly. He also managed them during their comeback at the Royal Albert Hall in 1984 where we met the Everlys for the first time. Next Christmas they presented a-ha with three Everly Brothers guitars made from the same tree! Being huge Beatles fans, growing up and knowing how influential the Everly Brothers had been for the early Beatles’ sound, we thought that it would be a nice tribute to cover one of their hits.”

The song reached top 40 on the USA, top 13 in the UK and topping the charts in Norway, home of the band.
