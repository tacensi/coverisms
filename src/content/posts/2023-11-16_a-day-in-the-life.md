Recorded in 1967, this was the last song on Sgt. Peppers Lonely Heart's Club Band. It is not the most covered Beatles' song, but [it features the top 10](https://www.beatlescovers.nl/covers/statistics.php).

Inspired by disparate news stories found in newspapers, the lyrics open with the tragic death of Tara Browne, heir to the Guinness fortune and a close friend of both John and Paul. Additionally, the song references the film [How I Won the War](insert link), in which John Lennon starred.

Although speculation arose regarding drug references in the song, Lennon and McCartney adamantly denied any such intent. The line "I'd love to turn you on" has drawn comparisons to Timothy Leary's mantra, "turn on, tune in, drop out." 

Infused with a mysterious ambiance, the song is often associated with psychedelic experiences, adding to its enigmatic aura.

The song ends with a E major chord, played by John, George and Mal Evans, Beatle's road manager, overdubbed and seemingly never ending.

## Wes Montgomery version

Wes Montgomery released his cover version on the album of the same name, in 1967. The album was considered less jazz oriented. The critic Scott Yanow wrote:

> Of his three A&M recordings, A Day in the Life (the first one) was by far the best and, although the jazz content is almost nil, the results are pleasing as background music.

The song is not immediately recognizable, with a more slow tempo and approaching the melody more freely. It starts with a small jazz ensemble, developing to an orchestra joins from the middle of the song onwards.

Montgomery claimed that he had never heard the original version before.

The album's B-side opens with yet another Beatles song, "Eleanor Rigby."
