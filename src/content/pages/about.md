  description: A blog dedicated to posting song covers, of all genres

I created this blog to post song covers, of all genres.

I like when an artist makes a good reinterpretation, often on a different direction the author intended. Sometimes it's so good it almost becomes the original, as in Hurt, by Johnny Cash, covered by Nine Inch Nails (or is it the other way around?).
